## Risk Scoring
All capitals pulled into the BlockHitch Ecosystem are assigned a “risk factor” that reflects the number and complexity of contract interactions, collateralization rates, and security of protocols interacted with. 


## Timelock
The mint function is timelocked for 9 weeks. This protects from any drastic tokenomic changes until the pulled capital has adequately circulated and governance is 100% community owned. Investors will make these decisions for themselves.
